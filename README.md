# NJGen-Discord-Halloween-Quiz

This is a basic Halloween quiz code but feel free to learn some basics from it or just leech off it.

You'll need the following modules:
npm install fs

You'll need the following folders:
Create a "halloweenquestions" folder
Instead that, make a "answers" folder, "completed" folder, "ready" folder and "totalscore" folder.

Then inside of the "halloweenquestions", you'll need the main questions them self which you can find in the questions folder of this repository.
In the "answers" folder, you'll also need the questions answers which is in this repository folder too.

That's pretty much it. Read through the codes notes and it should help out.
