# NJGen-Discord-Halloween-Quiz

This is a basic Halloween quiz code but feel free to learn some basics from it or just leech off it.

You'll need the following modules:
fs

You'll need the following folders:
Create a "halloweenquestions" folder
Instead that, make a "answers" folder, " completed folder", "ready" folder and "totalscore" folder.

Then instead of the "halloweenquestions", you'll need the main questions them self which you can find in this repository too.
In the "answers" folder, you'll also need the questions answers which is in this repository folder too.

That's pretty much it. Read through the codes notes and it should help out.
